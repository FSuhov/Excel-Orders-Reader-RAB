# Excel-Orders-Reader-RAB
The source code of C# project to read and combine the orders in excel files into one summary file

The application has been developed for my friends leading the small company who
sells the gear and clothing for extreme sports. The company collects the orders
from shops, combines it into one order and send this order to manufacturer.
Manager receives many excel files in the specific format (quit complicated)
and manually combines the data from multiple files into another file with different formatting.
So this application is created in order to replace manual work.

MAIN FEATURES:
- C# language;
- simple WPF user interface, using Metro Mohapps controls;
- extensive use of references to Office Libraries in Visual Studio.

The current version is under testing. The pending improvements to be done are:
- handle exceptions for wrong files selected;
- improve WPF user interface.

Thank you for revieing,
